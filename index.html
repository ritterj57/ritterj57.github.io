<a name="Introduction" class="anchor" href="#Introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>As a part of  a course I have recently taken online (Udacity 359: Intro to Data Science), I was tasked at looking at different sets of data such as public transportation data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which covers public transit in New York City.  </p>
<p>I designed this project in mind to look at the impact of various aspects of weather, as well as gas prices on entries into the MTA system. The question being does inclement weather cause statistically significant number of people to avoid the MTA system.  In addition, does the price of gas have an impact as well on the number of MTA entrants? I believe that this questions are answered adequately the regression results. </p>

<p>If you were unfamilar with the MTA or it's structure this should give you some context. The map above is the New York City subway system with various lines and stops. Overall there are 552 stations and the Remote Unit xls file linked above gives  a key of all of the stations. </p>

<p>The data here is taken from the Udacity 359: Intro to Data Science course, who had taken this data from MTA. The gas data was taken from the US Energy Information Agency. Respectively the variables stand for hourly entries at a turnstile, hourly exists from a turnstile, the means of dew points, pressure, wind speed and temperature and lastly the average weekly price of gas in that area.</p>

<p> Here we can see some interesting parts of the data at a first glance. Entries and exits have an odd distribution given that the mean minus the normal standard deviation for each would give us a negative number. Intuitively this means that there are much more instances of lower numbers of riders per turnstile per hour but there exists a smaller but still non-negligible number of instances where a high number of people are going through a turnstile per hour. In addition, the number of exits are smaller on average than the entries as the MTA is not as interested in this data and in some areas passengers may be able to use exists that do not record this data. </p>

<p> Looking at the weather data we can see that this data looks much more normal than our entries and exit data does. This is, as we would expect it given that the data was captured all from the same month here.  </p>

<p> One of the issues that I did wind up having with my gas data was that I was not able to find data that was on that minute of a timescale and from areas in the immediate surrounding area of the particular station which would have been ideal. Instead, what I was able to find was the weekly gas data for the region, which I then imputed for the matching weeks, which is not an ideal substitute. Adding on to this that statistical variation in the data. This data though does give similar results that I had obtained in writing my Economics Senior Seminar Thesis where I discussed the impact of petrol taxes on rail ridership in the Eurozone. In addition, the economic theory comparing public and private transportation is very well established and my results do agree with it. Overall, while not having the most quality data available for this portion of the analysis I am very confident of my results given past work by others and myself in economics and data analysis. If one wanted a more robsut result of this in particular I would recommend looking at larger time scales of weeks if not months as I did previously.</p>

<a name="Data Visuals" class="anchor" href="Data Visuals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Visuals.</h3>
<p>Diving a bit further into the hourly entires number I can see that concerns are founded but are less concerning as I continue to look at the data. </p>
<p><img src = "images/plainEnt.png"></p>
<p>Looking at simply the plain data for entries here we see what I had described in the sections above.</p>

<p><img src = "images/logEntTot.png"></p>
<p>But if we look instead at the numbers after taking the log of Entries we can see a picture of more normal looking data.</p>
<p><img src = "images/netLogEntries.png"></p>
<p>Breaking down data by fills too also produces data that looks very normal by station. This is net entires.</p>
<p><img src = "images/entryFills.png"></p>
<p> And perhaps looking at individual distributions overall gives the most clear visual picture. Above are the entries by station, below are net distributions also by station. </p>
