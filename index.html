<a name="Introduction" class="anchor" href="#Introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>As a part of  a course I have recently taken online (Udacity 359: Intro to Data Science), I was tasked at looking at different sets of data such as public transportation data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which covers public transit in New York City.  </p>
<p>I designed this project in mind to look at the impact of various aspects of weather, as well as gas prices on entires into the MTA system. The question being does incliment weather cause statistically significant number of people to avoid the MTA system and does the price of gas have an impact as well on the number of MTA entrants. I believe that this questions are answered adequetely the the regression results. </p>

<p>The data here is taken from the Udacity 359: Intro to Data Science course, who had taken this data from MTA. The gas data was taken from the US Energy Information Agency. Respectively the variables stand for hourly entries at a turnstile, hourly exists from a turnstile, the means of dewpoints, pressure, windspeed and temperature and lasty the average weekly price of gas in that area.</p>

<p> Here we can see some interesting parts of the data at a first glance. Entries and exits have an odd distribution given that the mean minus the normal standard deviation for each would give us a negative number. Intitively this means that there are much more instances of lower numbers of riders per turnstile per hour but there exists a smaller but still non-negligable number of instances where a high number of people are going through a turnstile per hour. Also the number of exits are smaller on average than the entries as the MTA isn't as interested in this data and in some areas passangers may be able to use exists that don't record this data. </p>

<p> Looking at the weather data we can see that this data looks much more normal than our entries and exit data does. This is as we would expect it given that the data was captured all from the same month here.  </p>

<p> One of the issues that I did wind up having with my gas data was that I was not able to find data that was on that minute of a timescale and from areas in the immediate surrounding area of the particular station which would have been ideal. Instead what I was able to find was the weekly gas data for the region which I then imputed for the matching weeks, which isn't a very ideal subsitute. Adding on to this that much statistical variation in the data. This data though does give similar results that I had obtained in writing my Economics Senior Seminar Thesis where I discussed the impact of petrol taxes on rail ridership in the Eurozone. Also the economic theory comparing public and private transportation is very well established and my results do agree with it. All in all while not having the most quality data available for this portion of the analysis I am very confident of my results given past work by myself and others in economics and data analysis. If one wanted a more robsut result of this in particular I would recommend looking at larger time scales of weeks if not months as I did previously.</p>

<p>Now off to the fun part and why it pays to use statistical software. Here I regressed entries on exits, some of the weather data available to me as well as gas prices and I used station dummy variables. </p>
